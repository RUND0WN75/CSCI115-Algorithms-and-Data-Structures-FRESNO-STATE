Problem Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to gain experience in working with Binary Search Tree (BST).

For this lab assignment, you will be providing an implementation of BST for the List-1.h 
header file provided, which specifies a BST for integer type. Specifically, you will need to:
1. Create a constructor that creates an empty tree in constant time.
2. Insert a key into the tree in O (log n) time (assuming that the tree stays balanced); if the key is already in the tree, then this operation should have no effect.
3. Print the tree in post-order traversal.
4. Return the largest key in the tree in O (log n) time.
5. Search a number for lookup in the tree. If found, display the value. If not found, display a message that it is not found.
