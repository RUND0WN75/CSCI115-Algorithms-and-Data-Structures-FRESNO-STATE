Problem Introduction

The goal of this experiment exercise is to review Stacks and Linked List and understanding their operations.

Tasks:

Write a program to create a stack data structure (do not use the built-in stack class) using arrays. It should support Push, Pop and Peek operations.
            To-do:

Create a stack using arrays with an array size of 10.
Push integers 20, 40, 60 into the stack.
Print the items in stack.
Pop the item from the stack and print the popped item.
Peek the stack and print the top-most element of the stack (do not remove it)
Print the stack.
Expected Output:

Items in the stack: 60, 40, 20

Popped item is: 60

Peeked item is: 40

Items in the stack: 40, 20

   2. Write a program to create a linked list structure. It should support insert and delete operations.

            To-do:

                  A.  Insert at the beginning of the Linked List:

Insert a node with data value 60 in the first position.   
Insert a node with data value 40 in the first position. 
Insert a node with data value 20 in the first position.   
                                 20 -> 40 -> 60

     B. Print the linked list elements.

     C. Delete the first element of the linked list and print the linked list. 

                       40 -> 60

     D. Delete the last element of the linked list and print the linked list.

          40

Expected Output:

Items in the linked list: 20, 40, 60

Items in the linked list after deleting the first element: 40, 60

Items in the linked list after deleting the last element: 40
