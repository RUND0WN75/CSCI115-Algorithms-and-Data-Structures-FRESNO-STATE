Problem Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to gain experience in working with binary heaps and priority queues.

For this lab assignment, you should provide an implementation of Priority Queue ADT using Binary Heaps. Your program should:

Accept a list of numbers as input
Build a binary heap of the given elements
Ask the user for the order of ascending or descending
Output the proper ordering for the given list (Heap Sort)
Print the min and max values from the list (per userâ€™s request)
Extract min or max value
Modify values in the heap
Add elements to the heap
