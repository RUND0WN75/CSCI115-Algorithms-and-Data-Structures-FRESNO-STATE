Problem Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to gain experience in working with two sorting algorithms “Selection Sort and Merge Sort” and analyzing their time complexities and comparing them to one another.

Tasks

Write a program that takes a list and sorts it using Selection Sort.
Write a program that takes a list and sorts it using Merge sort with recursion.
Compare the execution time for the following three conditions:
The list is sorted
The list is half sorted
The list is reverses
