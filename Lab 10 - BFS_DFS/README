For this lab assignment, you will be providing an implementation of Breadth First Search and Depth First Search of a graph with a
maximum size of 10 nodes, numbered from 1 to 10. The input to the program will be the number of
nodes and the adjacency list which are also the parameters to the two functions DFS and BFS. The
output from your program will be the list of nodes visited in depth first order and a list of nodes visited in
breadth first order.
Hint #1: In both algorithms it is necessary to keep up with whether a node has been visited or not. This
can be done with a one-dimensional int or Boolean array that contains 10 slots.
